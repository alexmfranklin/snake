# SNAIKE 

SNAIKE is a project built to make a competent player of the classic game of Snake using artificial intelligence. This project uses the Genetic Neural Network Algorithm with a custom implemented neural network. 

Multiple snakes are spawned every generation. The amount of snakes and number of generations can be customized in the program. After each generation plays for an alloted amount of time, the snakes who ate the most fruit are taken and the weights of their neural networks swapped in minor ways to simulate breeding. 

After each generation the snakes get consecutively better, until we have very competetant snakes!
